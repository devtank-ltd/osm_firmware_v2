This is the out of support OSM models.

A model is a configuration and hardware platform.

Currently these are:

* env01a - Back port of new firmware to original ESP32 based OSM Env01 Rev A. Not all drivers are working.
* env01b - Original STM32 hardware for new OSM firmware. Testing is only if it builds.
* env01c - Second STM32 hardware of OSM. Testing is only if it builds.
