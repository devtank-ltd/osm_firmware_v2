Devtank OpenSmartMonitor
========================

This is a firmware for Devtank's OpenSmartMonitor based round the STML4.

Build requirements are:

make
gcc-arm-none-eabi
picolibc-arm-none-eabi

To program a OpenSmartMonitor you're need either "stm32flash" or "openocd" and to have soldered wired on the right pins....

This is all still work in progress and inherits code from previous Devtank STM projects.
