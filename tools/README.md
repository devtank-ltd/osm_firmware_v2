## 1. Configuration Scripts

There is also a file for configuration scripts in the `config_scripts` directory.
These are to manipulate the persistent memory on the OSM Sensor.
There are three main functions of this: save a config, load a config and wipe a config.

Consult `config_scripts/README.md` for usage.
